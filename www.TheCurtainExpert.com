Aside from the fact that thermal lined drapes can save you money in the long run, this type of window treatment offers other advantages. These days most people own a lot of electronic equipment. Some people have a television and/or computer in almost every room in their house, not to mention home theaters, media rooms or home offices. When using your electronic gizmos, you want to be able to control natural light sources and have a cool, comfortable, quiet environment to work or relax in. Sunlight streaming through the window and reflecting off a television or computer screen; the sound of dogs barking or kids playing; or the sweltering heat of summer can all interfere with your ability to concentrate or enjoy what you are doing. Curtains that block light, heat and noise can be a wise investment in any room.

The living room or great room is another area that can benefit from this type of window treatment. Whether your room is furnished with valuable antiques, custom designer pieces, or furniture from Ikea, you want to protect your investment. Excessive heat and UV exposure can damage your furniture.

Nowhere is the control of light, heat and noise more important than in the bedroom. Sleep deprivation is a leading problem in the world today and one that poses major health and safety risks. Anything that you can do to create sleeping environments in your home that promote restful, rejuvenating sleep, is an investment in your own well being and that of your family.

Thermal lined curtains offer many advantages over traditional window treatments and can ultimately make your home livable and environmentally friendly.
