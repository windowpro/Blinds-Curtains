===============

You can insulate your thermal drapes by adding a thick cotton wool interlining material between the curtain and the thermal lining. Drapery that combines thermal, blackout and insulating properties will give you maximum heat insulation and light absorption, effectively reducing your energy costs. The insulation also has sound dampening effect, blocking out street and traffic noise.
